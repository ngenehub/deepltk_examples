# Waveform Signal Classification


#### Detailed articles on this and similar projects can be found on Ngene's [Website](https://www.ngene.co/blog) <br/> The blog posts guides on developing Deep Neural Networks to solve problems, ranging from basic to advanced, using the [DeepLTK](https://www.ngene.co/deep-learning-toolkit-for-labview) toolkit.
----

In this example, we will explore how Deep Neural Networks can be employed to model the signal classifier.
<br/>
The model takes various signal types as input, including Sine, Triangle, Sawtooth, Square, and Noise, and employs Neural Networks to classify the signal's type accurately.
<br/>

The project consist of two main VIs
- [1_Waveform_Signal_Classifier(Training).vi](#training-vi)
- [2_Waveform_Signal_Classifier(Inference).vi](#inference-vi)
