# Waveform Signal Regression


#### Detailed articles on this and similar projects can be found on Ngene's [Website](https://www.ngene.co/blog) <br/> The blog posts guides on developing Deep Neural Networks to solve problems, ranging from basic to advanced, using the [DeepLTK](https://www.ngene.co/deep-learning-toolkit-for-labview) toolkit.

In this example, we will explore how Deep Neural Networks can be employed to predict signal frequency.
<br/>
During the training phase, we will provide a requested number of noisy waveforms for each signal type with random parameters. In the inference section, the goal is to predict the frequency of these waveforms.
<br/>

The project consist of two main VIs
- [1_Waveform_Signal_Regression(Training).vi](#training-vi)
- [2_Waveform_Signal_Regression(Inference).vi](#inference-vi)
