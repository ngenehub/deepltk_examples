# Multiple Output Logistic Regression


#### Detailed articles on this and similar projects can be found on Ngene's [Website](https://www.ngene.co/blog) <br/> The blog posts guides on developing Deep Neural Networks to solve problems, ranging from basic to advanced, using the [DeepLTK](https://www.ngene.co/deep-learning-toolkit-for-labview) toolkit.

In this example, we will explore how Deep Neural Networks can be employed to model the Boolean Adder.
<br/><br/>
The task is to compute the sum of 8-bit integers with help of Deep Neural Network.
<br/>
In this context, each input and output is being represented as 8 separate binary values, meaning predicting 8 binary outputs based on 16 binary inputs.
<br/><br/>
See the visual demonstration of the problem below:

The project consists of two main VIs
- [1_Boolean_Adder(Training).vi](#training-vi)
- [2_Boolean_Adder(Inference.vi)](#inference-vi)
